In preparation for a presentation I'm making at [Boston Software Craftsmanship](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Software-Craftsmanship/) in March,
I've been practicing a kata to convert arabic numbers to roman numerals.  I've
based this on a katacast by [Corey Haines](http://blog.coreyhaines.com/2012/12/roman-numerals-kata-with-commentary.html),
but there are some changes to illustrate baby steps more effectively.
