As a profession, we are not known for our communication skills.  Logical
computers are so much easier to understand than emotional people.  To fully
excel, though, we must be able to do both effectively.

Most outsiders view us as interpreters, translating descriptions into a form
computers can understand.  This is not all we do, but developing this skill
will make several other aspects of our job easier.

Why Communication Is Important?
-------------------------------

Requirements are usually vague.  We actually need to translate *ideas* into a
form computers understand.  A well placed conversation can improve our
understanding of the goal, which in turn may transform a complex solution into a
simple one.

Early in my career, I was asked to convert a list of strings into an html table
with the elements sequenced vertically.  HTML tables are much easier to sequence
horizontally than vertically.  Those were the requirements, though, and I spent
a good deal of time making them work.

Several days later, I was chatting with the author of those requirements.  I
commented on the difficulty, it turns out that he didn't actually care about
the direction.  I could have easily avoided that effort with a five minute
conversation.

Accept Feedback
---------------

I'm always right.  I *know* my idea is going to work, I've got a vision and all
variant suggestions be damned.

This is extremely dangerous.  We need to *accept* that there might be flaws in
the idea, and *listen* to the feedback describing those flaws.  We don't want to
spend weeks building something, only to discover it was the wrong thing.

[Pretotyping](http://www.pretotyping.org), or doing the bare minimum to prove
the idea will work, is a great technique in addressing this problem.  We want to
create the possibility of feedback as early as possible.

Get Along
---------

Enemies accumulate and make life way too hard.  It may seem reasonable to piss a
few people off now to get something done, but it will make future interactions
harder.  And there *will* be future interactions, the interest rate on a loan
against our reputation is always too high.

How Can We Get Better?
----------------------

The [Software Craftsmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org)
movement says that we should practice outside of work to hone our skills.
[Toastmasters](http://www.toastmasters.org) is an organization dedicated to just
that. I'll be joining in August, and I suggest you do too.
