When developing software, there are a few things that we do over and over.  By
examining them separately, we can better understand what areas need
development.  This knowledge will provide guidance during our practice
sessions.

Communication
=============

Also known as the art of figuring out what people want and giving it to them
politely.  Most developers are pretty bad at this one, mainly because it's much
harder for the people attracted to our field to figure out how to talk to people
than computers.

What makes this even harder is that people often don't know what they want when
they first ask for it.  Agile methodologies try to get around this problem by
short iteration with limited scope.  This makes it easier, but internalizing
small requests is still an important part of our job.

It's very easy to build something cool and make your stakeholder hate you at the
same time.  It may seem like it doesn't matter at the time, but consider these
questions:

* Will you be working with them again?
* What will that person say to other people in your company?
* Does anybody else agree it's cool?

Being caustic during a project is like taking a loan on your reputation.  It
might make your life easier now, but you'll end up paying that back with
interest later.

Finally, if you're like me, you're constantly getting Ideas.  This really
doesn't matter at all unless you can explain them clearly.  Being able to
clearly present an idea will give it the chance it deserves.

Fortunately, there's an organization dedicated to improving communication
skills.  Join your local [Toastmasters](toastmasters.org) chapter and try to
focus on the skills I mentioned above.

Design
======

There are so many books with (conflicting) advice about what makes good design.
Boiled down to it's essence, though, design is the act of structuring code in an
easy to understand way.

This encompasses many different activities:

* Refactoring
* Naming
* Component Interaction

There are several books written on each of these components, so I'm not going to
go into this much here.  My [Readability Rating](readability-rating.colinwilliams.name) 
is an attempt to better understand what works better in practice, but it's still
very much a work in progress.

Testing
=======

When testing, you're doing one of two things:

* Validating behavior
* Exploring boundaries

Problem Solving
===============
